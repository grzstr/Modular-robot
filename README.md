# Modular robot
The project was based on servo control using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The robot consisted of modules, each of which could rotate in two planes. The modules could be connected together to form a snake robot or manipulator. The program allows you to save the robot's current position as a point and then reconstruct the trajectory of its movements.
